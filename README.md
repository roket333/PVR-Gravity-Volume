## Gravity Volume
Gravity Volume is an asset for Unreal Engine 4.21, designed for Pavlov VR map making, made by Roket Gamer

### How to install
1. Download the latest release
2. Open the .zip file
3. Open your map project and navigate to your UGCXXXXXXXXXX folder (each X representing a number)
4. If you opened it in UE4, extend the content browser on the left, right-click and click "Show in Explorer"
5. Drag the files from the .zip into the folder you want them, I recommend using a seperate folder for blueprints
And that's it!

### How to use
It's quite simple to use, you drag it from the content browser to the editor window and mess with it from there
You can rotate, scale, and move it and tinker with the settings for what works
Remember, the arrow when not in point attraction mode is the direction of gravity/force

### Notes to remember
I'm not responsible for any damage done to your hardware, software, or project by the asset, even though no such damage should happen, better safe than sorry
In point attraction mode, linear and angular damping don't work right, and I don't know why

### Anticipated questions and FAQ
##### Can I give other people the zip file?
No, please direct them to this site to download it

##### Can I modify your blueprint?
You sure can! You can share it too, just be sure to credit me for making the original asset

##### Can you add X to the asset?
I'm open to recommendations, but remember I am very inexperienced when it comes to making blueprints, so somethings might not be doable at the time

##### I found a bug!
That's not a question
Joking aside, if you've found a bug, please let me know by telling me on Discord or submitting an issue on the GitHub repository

### Troubleshooting
##### I placed it down but it's not doing anything!
By default, the force is 200 units per second, so you might have to raise it a bit

##### Players aren't affected by point attraction!
No, they're not due to me not knowing how to smoothly add force to a pawn, which caused players to teleport to the point of attraction

##### I have a problem that isn't listed here!
